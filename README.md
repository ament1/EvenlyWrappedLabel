Description
--------------

`EvenlyWrappedLabel` is a `UILabel` subclass that will vertically distribute text evenly across any number of lines, preventing text from grouping up at the top and also preventing single word orphans from taking up the entire bottom line.
 
 Examples:
 
1. This text:
 
        This sentence has a lot of words on
        the top line.
 
 Becomes:
 
        This sentence has a lot
        of words on the top line.
 
2. This text:
 
        This sentence has a single
        orphan.
 
 Becomes:
 
        This sentence has
        a single orphan.


**Works with iOS 9.0+ and Xcode 9.0.0+.**

<a name="installation"> Installation </a>
--------------

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate `EvenlyWrappedLabel` into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'EvenlyWrappedLabel'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

In case Xcode complains (<i>"Cannot load underlying module for EvenlyWrappedLabel"</i>) go to Product and choose Clean (or simply press <kbd>⇧</kbd><kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>K</kbd>).

### Manually

If you prefer not to use CocoaPods, you can integrate `EvenlyWrappedLabel` into your project manually.
